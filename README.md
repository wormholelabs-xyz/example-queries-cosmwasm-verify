## Queries Verification on Cosmwasm PoC

This is a demo of verifying and parsing [Wormhole Queries](https://wormhole.com/queries/) on Cosmwasm.

This example uses the Wormhole Core contract to get the current guardian set.

Since the core contract does not expose a function to verify signatures against a payload, this example replicates
that code from the `parse_and_verify_vaa` core contract method in `verify_signatures_from_hash`.

This example also uses the `wormhole-query-sdk-rust` repo from Wormhole Labs to parse the query responses.

It provides a trivial example of parsing a query response for a `totalSupply` call on the WETH contract.

## Running the Tests

To run the tests do:

```shell
$ cargo test
```

## Building the Artifact

To build the wasm file for deployment do:

```shell
$ scripts/build.sh
```

## Testing in Tilt

You can play with this contract in the tilt environment using the sample query program.

### Deploying to Tilt

Before deploying this contract to tilt, do the following:

- Build the artifact as described in the previous step.
- Bring up tilt with the `--terra2` option.
- Check the `terra2-terrad` output in tilt and verify the address in the `Instantiated cw_wormhole.wasm at` line matches
  the value of `wormhole_contract` in `scripts/deploy_to_tilt.sh`. Update the script if necessary.

The first time you do the deployment, you need to do:

```shell
$ cd scripts
$ npm ci
```

Then you can deploy the contract by doing:

```shell
$ script/node deploy_to_tilt.js
```

### Run the example query

Once you have deployed the contract, you can run the sample query by doing the following.

First, verify the value of the `contract` in `scripts/query.js` matches the deployed address in the previous step. Update the script if necessary.

Then run the script by doing:

```shell
$ scripts/node query.js
```
